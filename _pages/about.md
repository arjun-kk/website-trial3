👋🏽 Hello, there. I am a PhD student in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Florida. 

![Illustration of a philosopher thinking about world models](/images/AIGeneratedPhilCogMap.png){: .align-right width="300px"}My research focuses on issues at the intersection of AI, cognitive science and natural sciences. My current work focuses on the notion of cognitive maps and world models in general. This involves clarifying the role that the notion of world models play in explaining phenomenon, and how they may be represented in our mind and how they may get implemented in DNNs.

Additionally, I am interested in how DNNs help model aspects of human cognition and the limits of such modelling. I am also interested in the issues of generalisability in such networks.

I have [taught](/website-trial3/teaching/) courses in ethics of tech and intro to philosophy. You will find the syllabi for the courses [here](/website-trial3/teaching).
